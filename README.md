## Node Curriculum Assignment 


## What the Student Already Knows

Students have covered the basic structure and syntax of small (single-file) command-line applications. They have not, up until this point, used `require`

## Learning Goal 

This lesson introduces students to dependency management in Node.js . It should demonstrate the different ways that `require()` works — highlighting some of its quirks and virtues — and it should also introduce them to `npm`

## Learning Objectives- Students should be able to: 

- Pull in external dependencies for their applications
- Spread their applications out over several files instead of writing everything in one file
- Explain different export strategies and how to use each strategy in their application
